2. KUET BUS: This is one of the two implemented features. This feature is very nicely engineered in such a way that one has to access the internet for only one time to gather the infromation from the official website. Then the data is saved to the local database. The feature is implemented by desigining an API and mySQL database.

3. TEACHER SEARCH: This feature provides the user with the data of ther teachers of KUET. It is also engineered very carefully as there was the implementation of the rapid API and mySQL database that stores data locally so tha user can see the data even in offline.
Here the user also can search a teacher he/she wants.

Future Scope:
  1. The UX and UI design will be updated as we are currently working on it.
  2. As the app works in both offline and online this is so handy to use.
  3. The data reloading from the website takes time for the first time when the user open this app. So we are also working on this so that user doesnt have to wait too much for the data to reload.
  4. This wiil be helpful for the KUETians only.
